I will be taking a break during July 22nd to July 29th. This means there will be no streams, no videos, and email response time may be slower than usual.

I know I just had a break over the week of July 1st to July 9th, but this is my second and final break of the year.

This time, I won't be travelling to a foreign place for vacation, but I'm going to see family in my country.

# What this means

## For viewers

No videos or streams will release over this period. Unlike my previous break, I **do not** plan to be active through my [community posts](https://www.youtube.com/@MoldyGD/community), as this is not so much a vacation.

## For creators

I will likely be inactive and slow to respond to direct messages.

## For brands

Feel free to continue emailing me over this time, just be aware that I likely won't be able to do any integrations while I am on break.
