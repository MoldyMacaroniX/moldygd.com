Introducing DashLink, my new Geometry Dash YouTuber group!

The goal is to create a server where we can hang out in voice call and post ads for video invites without having to filter out people.

If you're interested in applying, have 10,000 subscribers, and meet our [Quality Standards](/dashlink-quality-standards/), then [join our Discord to apply](https://link.moldygd.com/dl-discord)! You can also join the server with under 10,000 subscribers, but you won't be eligible to apply until you reach 10,000.
