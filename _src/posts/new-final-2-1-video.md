title: I Confess. I Made One More 2.1 Video.

While I originally said [I would not release another video until Geometry Dash 2.2](/my-final-2-1-video-is-out-now-what/), with the update [being delayed](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-delayed-until-november-2023/) (seriously?) I went ahead and made one more video in 2.1.

Now that we know RobTop cannot be trusted, I will say right now that if 2.2 gets delayed until December, I will make another 2.1 video. And I will make another one if it gets delayed until January. And so on.

But I will admit, it sucks not knowing when 2.2 will release. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if it got delayed until a decent way into 2024.

I'm currently in this weird state of limbo where I want to do things in the game but can't because I know it will all be nullified once 2.2 releases. But if I knew 2.2 would be delayed by this much, I probably would have made another level or spent more time on my [last level](/my-final-2-1-level/).

At least I have more time to play all Moldy Challenges and finish Monsterstream.
