If you're looking for a more traditional Minecraft experience, then this season is for you!

There will be two teams: -X and +X (yes, that's the team names). They will each have four days to build a base to defend their "Core," a mob/item (still TBD exactly what this will be) that the opposing team will be tasked with destroying.

A border on the x-axis will separate both teams, but on day 5, the border will drop and the battle will begin!

Each team will act as a civilization and will face the difficult task of coordination. Some players may be good at speedrunning, others at building. Some may be good at trapping, others at PVP. It is up to your team to effectively manage everyone's skillsets to protect your Core for as long as possible!

If you apply before the deadline, you will be able to decide which team you're on, so you and your friends can join the same team. But we will likely keep applications open after the deadline, but players who are accepted will instead be assigned to whichever team has less active players / less skillsets in order to keep things fair. More info in **#read-before-applying**.

# The final rules may be adjusted, but right now, it is looking like:

- There will be two teams and each team will have one half of the Overworld and Nether (but not End) to themselves. You cannot enter the other team's half of the world.
- Each team will have four days to build a base to protect their Core.
- On the fifth day of the event, the border will drop and the coordinates to both Cores will be revealed. Both teams will raid the other team's base while defending their own. How long will your Core survive?
- Unlike past events, there is no perma-death this time! But we may add a small temp ban (e.g. 10 minutes) based on player feedback.
- The Overworld and Nether will be divided evenly, but the End will not have a border and will be fair game, so going there will be risky, as the other team could hunt you down.
- We may consider resetting the End mid-event if one team gets a monopoly on loot like Elytras and Shulkers such that it would make the final battle too unfair, but this is still TBD. We want things to be fair - if one team gets more elytras, that's fair game. But we also want things to be fun.
- There will be no world border (or a very large world border), but your Core must be within a 1000x1000 block diameter of spawn (we may make this bigger, still TBD).
- Betraying your team will be against the rules. So please only join the team you are okay to stay loyal to! We will ban/blacklist players from this and future events if we have reason to suspect that they are cheating. Alternatively, we may allow teams to vote out members who are not contributing.
- No restrictions this time; all structures and mobs will spawn as usual. Difficulty will be set to hard mode. Only catch is some exploits (such as breaking bedrock) will be disabled (PaperMC does this by default) and we might(?) ban farms that require the End spawn platform or End exit portal (or not and have both teams fight over them).
