Here is a list of rules and settings for my videos. This is mostly just for me to use as reference while briefing video participants, but I'll put it here to serve as a public record.

**If you are a video participant:** please try your best to follow everything here. That being said, it is probable that some of you will accidentally screw up, such as by instinctly pressing the "R" key or forgetting to remove your Mega Hack UI text. If that happens, just go on with the video. If there is a quick fix, feel free to do it, but please don't interupt the game/whatever we're doing unless it is absolutely vital.

The **most important** sections are about Globed settings and Recording Settings. **Please try your best to not screw these up.**

# Video Rules

Unless otherwise stated, the following are not allowed in my videos:

- Everything obvious like Noclip, Speedhack, etc.
- Pausing to restart the level or pressing the "R" key to do that is not allowed
- Practice mode is not allowed
- Show hitboxes on death (please turn this off)

# Face Cam

- Only use a face cam if:
    - You can record it **separately** from the raw footage (such as by sending me two files: the gameplay footage and a seperate file for your face cam)
- If you are using a face cam, please clap at the start so it is easier to sync audio!

# Vanilla and Mega Hack Settings

- Disable all UI elements (no mega hack UI or platformer mode timer)
    - In the vanilla game, this includes the platformer mode timer, FPS, and anything else of the like
    - In Mega Hack, this includes any UI stats you typically use while playing
- Unless otherwise noted, disable in-game music and SFX.

# Globed Settings

- Test proximity chat before hand, if possible. Don't forget to make sure you have the correct mic selected!
- **Voice tab:** Make sure voice chat and voice proximity are enabled, don't use classic proximity, don't use "only friends."
- **Level UI tab:** Disable everything
- **Player tab:** Disable everything except death effects and opacity
- If we're doing a team video where you will be communicating with your team through a Discord call, mute your teammates in Globed to avoid echo (this will be stated by me)

# Recording Settings

## Video Settings

- **Resolution:** 1920x1080
- **FPS:** 60
- **Bitrate** Whatever doesn't look awful. I use 30,000 but you can probably get away with lower for GD.
- **File Type:** `.mkv` is safest but `.mp4` also works. `.mov` is *fine* but its easier on us if you use `.mkv` or `.mp4`. **MY EDITOR SUPPORTS MKV FILES SO YOU DON'T NEED TO CONVERT THEM!**

## Audio

- If you **CAN** do multiple audio tracks, include the following tracks:
    - Your mic (this is MOST IMPORTANT, make sure there is a track with your mic audio separated)
    - The Discord call (unless we're solely using in-game proximity chat)
    - Geometry Dash (only if we're using in-game proximity chat)
- If you **CAN NOT** do multiple audio tracks, then just record your mic audio (not the Discord call, game audio, or anything else)

## Test Recording

- Before every video, I will ask everyone to do a test recording. This is so that we can make sure the quality is good, the correct mic/speakers were selected, and all audio tracks are working.
- Make sure to chuck this test recording into a video editor to make sure all audio tracks are working!

## Multiple Recordings

If you are worried about losing a recording before it's finished, from crashing/corrupting/whatever, you're allowed to stop recording and start a new recording again so long as you do so quickly as to not mess up sync too much. That being said, I would refrain from using this approach, and instead encourage you to record in the `.mkv` file format through OBS.

# Sending Footage

Here are ways to send your footage, in order of preference!

## 1) Upload to Google Drive

- **Max file size:** 15 GB

Google drive can support unzipped files up to 15 GB.

## 2) Upload to Google Drive, Zipped

- **Max file size:** ~30 GB

Zip your file to reduce its size by around half.

## 3) Upload to YouTube

- **Max file size:** virtually infinite 

**__IMPORTANT:__** Make sure when uploading to YouTube you only include your mic, **as YouTube doesnâ€™t support multiple audio tracks!**

If you record with split audio tracks but still need to upload to YouTube, edit your recording so it only includes your mic audio. Please export in `.mp4` instead of `.mov`!
