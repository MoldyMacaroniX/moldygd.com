I am going to **VidCon Anaheim** this year!

VidCon Anaheim is a yearly convention for digital media creators and fans to convene in real life over June 26-29. Considering I'm a YouTuber, I decided to go. And I'm not going alone!

I will be going with fellow Geometry Dash YouTubers Tride, Sdslayer, and Vortrox. I've also heard that there are other Geometry Dash YouTubers who plan to show up!

# If you're going to VidCon this year:

**If you're going and you see us, feel free to say hi!** We won't bite (probably).

Just don't be creepy. We don't like stalkers...

We plan on playing things by ear, but if you're going, there's a good chance you'll be able to spot us.

**I plan on doing a face reveal [on my YouTube channel](https://link.moldygd.com/youtube) prior to the convention, so you'll know what I look like by VidCon!**

# If you're not going to VidCon this year:

**Don't worry, you can still follow us on our journey by following our [social media](/social-media/)!** In particular, you should keep an eye on my following platforms:
