title: The Best Geometry Dash Challenge Video?

I don't think so, but maybe it's a contender.

On August 31st, I released [I Survived Natural Disasters In Geometry Dash 2.2](https://youtu.be/G0ILGUYN7lI?si=sVJgwiFcE53MI0eN), a fun challenge video featuring myself and five other amazing YouTubers.

When people think of really good videos, I imagine it's the documentaries and other well edited commentary videos that come to mind. I can't imagine a traditional challenge video being anywhere near that list.

I want to make the best Geometry Dash videos I can, but not through documentaries and commentary videos. Not that I have anything against those—they are some of my most favorite content in the community. I just wish some of the let's play scene had the same care and dedication put into it.

That's what I've been trying to do—spend more time and effort on my challenge videos to make them some of the best content for the game. At least in the let's play space.

<!-- And I'm not the only one doing this. [Stallion](https://www.youtube.com/@StallionGD) comes to mind when I think of other Geometry Dash challenge YouTubers but channels like [MatMart](https://www.youtube.com/@MatMart) are starting to dip into that space again.

But other than Stallion, I can't think of other Geometry Dash YouTubers making this kind of content. -->

# But to my surprise...

**That is why I was totally surprised to see such positive reception on my latest natural disasters video.** These are the kind of comments I'm used to seeing on high-end documentaries, not Geometry Dash challenge videos.

I was worried that nobody would notice the effort I put into crafting an engaging story, or using VFX<sup>1</sup> to improve the levels in the video, or even appreciate that we took the time to build five decorated stages for one video, **where the building process of them wasn't even featured in the video**.

But people noticed all of that!

# Why this means especially a lot to me

I love comments that point out the effort that goes into my work solely because I often feel the work I put into my videos goes unnoticed due to them fitting into the let's play genre, and that genre is traditionally filled by simpler videos. And that's not a bad thing!

There's nothing wrong with simple videos. I would even go as far to say that YouTube as a whole needs them to survive. *Otherwise, all your favorite YouTubers would have an upload schedule worse than mine!*

It's just that I spend months working with others to come up with the best ideas, crafting dedicated levels for each of my videos, gathering a great cast to film it, and editing it to the best of our ability.

Despite all this, most viewers don't take note in the effort that went into its creation. And that's fine, because people are watching it, *especially when my channel averages nearly half a million views per video.* And that's all that matters. People can enjoy something without commenting on it, so I am in no right to complain!

# But this video goes an extra step further

After recording this video, I knew it would end up being a much bigger project than I anticipated. The footage we got was so good and the story that formed was incredible for a challenge video.

I knew I had good footage, but the problem came in the edit. I really wanted to tell the amazing story that was formed in the recording, which is why I spent nearly **four times as long** on the edit than I normally do. I did multiple cuts of the footage before even writing the script because I wanted this video to be perfect.

I knew the video would be good no matter what just because of how amazing the footage was. I just wanted to make sure the video would be better than good because I didn't want such great footage to go to waste.

I still feel the video could've been better. But, I think that about everything. Nevertheless, I released something I was very proud of, more proud of than most of my videos.

# The comments you gave

These are some of the amazing comments you all left me. I won't include their names or anything, I just want to keep this as an archive. I would like to come back to this if I ever need motivation in the future!

Thanks for reading this whole article if you did! It really means the world to me that you care about this wild journey of a video.

I don't care how this video performs algorithmically. In fact, I'm not even expecting this video to perform well, and that's okay. I wanted to make this video because I wanted to, not because of views or money.

_<sup>1</sup>The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_effects&oldid=1173074770) defines VFX as "The integration of live-action footage and other live-action footage or CGI elements to create realistic imagery." In this context, live-action footage will include Geometry Dash footage. For most of the VFX in this video, we overlayed other Geometry Dash effects (such as rain) on top of the necessary footage and made adjustments to make it seamless. By this definition, I call what we did VFX, making this perhaps the first practical use of VFX in a Geometry Dash video to make levels look better._
