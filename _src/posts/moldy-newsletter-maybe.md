title: Should I Make A Newsletter?

Over the past few months, I've considered making a newsletter. I just never had an idea for one. But lately, I have!

The idea is that I will run a small, about weekly newsletter to update dedicated fans on my upcoming videos and streams. I will also give my thoughts on general Geometry Dash topics going around that week.

It may also cover random topics I'm interested in, [like this blog does](/archive/), but that won't be the focus.

There won't be a strict schedule, but it will probably go out about weekly.

This newsletter would only be for dedicated fans who want to know a lot more about my video production process so it will not be aimed at regular viewers!

If you are someone who would be interested in this, [let me know](/contact/)!
