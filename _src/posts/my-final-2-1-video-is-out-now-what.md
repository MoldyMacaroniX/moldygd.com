title: My Final 2.1 Video Is Out. Now What?
date: 2023-10-17
desc: Today, I will be releasing my final 2.1 video (asterisk). It does feel sort of surreal, but at the same time, I don't think my content will change so much in 2.2. My style of content can quite easily be adapted to 2.2, and I've already been making 2.2 videos for some time anyway. It'll take a bit of time to learn the new level editor, but otherwise, not much will change for me.

Today, I will be releasing my final 2.1 video.<sup>1</sup> It does feel sort of surreal, but at the same time, I don't think my content will change so much in 2.2. My style of content can quite easily be adapted to 2.2, and I've [already been making 2.2 videos for some time anyway](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvG1lI0KWDE2nGdNUBuvSoYQ4OV2r1Svb&si=QZY7-_kSI9WdWnEj). It'll take a bit of time to learn the new level editor, but otherwise, not much will change for me.

Currently, I am in this awkward state where I cannot work on any more videos, meaning I am essentially softlocked from making videos until 2.2 comes out. So, what should I do in the meantime?

I plan to release Monsterstream and play all Moldy Challenges before 2.2, but that has to be done all on stream. I don't have much planned for my off-stream hours.

I am a little busy outside of YouTube, as I typically have a lot of stuff going on in October to do with my family and friends. So maybe I should take a little break. Rest before the calm that is the storm of 2.2. Not focus on Geometry Dash and YouTube until 2.2.

But it still feels weird. I've been grinding YouTube for pretty much the entirety of the year. Even when I went on vacation, I still found myself responding to emails on the daily and managing production. To do pretty much nothing YouTube related feels off, as YouTube is my full time job.

We'll see what happens. A break sounds nice. But playing all Moldy Challenges does not. I don't know how many streams it'll takeâ€”that depends on how long I want to play each level. But I do want to get it done rather quickly to not have to finish it in 2.2.

What do you think?

*<sup>1</sup>That is assuming RobTop sticks to his word and [releases 2.2 in October](https://www.dashword.net/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/), but at this point, [I wouldn't be surprised if he's late yet again](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/).*
