title: Iris Gradu End Art Contest
date: 2023-08-04
---

Hello everyone! As you may know, I'm hosting a rainbow themed mega collab called **Iris Gradu**. However, this level still needs an end screen. But instead of getting someone to make one for us, we thought we'd host an end screen contest!

# The Contest Rules

The goal is simple: make a good end screen for our level. The requirements are as follows:

- You need to use these **color channels** and **group IDs**: 710-810
- You need to use color triggers to set the colors for your end screen
- Your end screen needs to fit the full width of the screen in the ship game mode
- The level's song is [Creo x Exyl - Cosmic War](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1211787) and the start offset for the end screen is **150 seconds**.
- You don't have to make a transition, as that will be done by someone else
- The level's text object font is **pusab** (the default font for a newly created level). That being said, we recommend you make your own custom font!

In addition, you must include the following information in the end screen:

- **Level Name:** Iris Gradu
- **Creators:** Ronlix, Purzin, V3ntique, Moldy, Kivixi, ClingingBog, Culuc, Bli, Kivvvi, **and you!** (For making the end screen.)

We recommend making your end screen dynamic. As in, use triggers to make it move instead of stay still. Remember to use spawn loops so whatever animations you make continue even once the level has ended. Also try and make your end screen rainbow and follow the level's theme. Here are some finished parts you can use as inspiration:

# Submission

The deadline is **August 20, 2023**, so make sure to submit your entry before then! You can submit your entry in [this Google form](https://forms.gle/Ghhd85fcKCawDVow9) via a public level ID, aka NOT an unlisted level. If you have any questions, check the description or ask us in the comments. Good luck!

As a reward, we will be using the winning entry in the real level. Good luck and remember to have fun!

            Set your colors using color triggers so when we save your part as a custom object it will retain the colors.

            You should have more than enough color channels and group IDs. If you really need more, you can reuse one's you've already used.
