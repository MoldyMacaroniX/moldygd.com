I made a game (kind of).

Recently, me and some friends made a game for a game jam. It was a group effort, so most of the game was created by other people, including most of the code, art, and sounds.

All I did was the level design and a bit of code to polish the game.

Regardless, this is pretty much my first real game ever. I'd love to get into game development one day (I'm a computer science major, like your dog), so I think this is a good first step.

If you want to play the game, you can play it [with this link](https://moldygd.itch.io/wick) (note that the game requires a keyboard and mouse, so it won't work on mobile).

So saying "I made a game" is slightly misleading. It's more accurate to instead say "I worked on a game."
