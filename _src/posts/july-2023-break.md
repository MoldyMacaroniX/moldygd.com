I will be taking a break during July 1st to July 9th. This means there will be no streams, no videos, and email response time may be slower than usual.

I typically take two weeks off every year, with this being the first. The next week I take off will likely be in August, but I am not sure as of this moment.

# What this means

## For viewers

No videos or streams will release over this period. I plan to be active through my [community posts](https://www.youtube.com/@MoldyGD/community) though!

## For creators

I will likely be inactive and slow to respond to direct messages.

## For brands

Feel free to continue emailing me over this time, just be aware that I likely won't be able to do any integrations while I am on break.
