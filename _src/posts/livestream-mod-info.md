I get asked a lot how to become a livestream mod for my channel. It is a bit of a complicated process, but I'll do my best to explain it here.

Stream mods are generally picked from two sources:

1. Staff of my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PqTUgx6).
2. Other Geometry Dash YouTubers who I personally know.

**Note for YouTubers: I don't hand out stream mod just because you are popular.** You have to be a very close friend of mine who I can trust to moderate the stream despite not being a Discord staff.

Here's the general roadmap for becoming a livestream mod:

1. **Be active in the Discord server and on streams.** We only accept Discord staff applications if we know you are active. You will also need to be a certain level in the server to be eligible for Discord staff.
2. **Form relations with Moldy or other staff members.** In order to be accepted for Discord staff, we need to know we can trust you. You will only have a chance at acceptance if a staff member can vouch for you.
3. **Apply and get accepted for Discord staff.** Applications typically open every few months.
4. **Pass the trainee staff phase to become a full staff.** After this, you will be eligible for stream mod if you are active in stream chat.
