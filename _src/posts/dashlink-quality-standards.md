# Quality Standards

## 1. Definitions

1. **Videos —** Long-form videos on the channel's "Videos" tab.
2. **Live streams —** Live streams on the channel's "Live" tab, including **vertical live streams**.
3. **Vertical live streams —** Live streams on the channel's "Live" tab, but that are streamed in a vertical resolution to take advantage of the shorts feed.
4. **Shorts —** Shorts on the channel's "Shorts" tab.
6. **Content —** Your **videos**, **shorts**, and **live streams**, as defined in § 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4.
6. **Brainrot —** Low effort **content** ideas, such as the typical stuff seen in the Geometry Dash shorts tab.
7. All of these definitions include unlisted **content** that was, at one point, public.
8. These terms will be bolded in this document.

## 2. Channel standards

1. The channel in question must feature predominantly **videos**, not **live streams** or **shorts**.
    1. Doing **live streams** and **shorts** are allowed, but they must not be the main focus of the channel.
2. You must be the owner of whatever channel you are applying with in order to get accepted.

## 3. Content quality

1. Everything in this section applies to all forms of **content** on the channel, including **videos**, **live streams**, and **shorts**, unless otherwise specified.
    1. This means that even if a channel has good **videos**, if they do **brainrot** shorts on the side, they will not be eligible to join DashLink. Shorts must be high quality.
2. Absolutely no **brainrot** **content** is allowed on your channel.
3. Your **content** must feature, at a minimum, your voice.
    1. Hiring a voice actor or using text-to-speech is not allowed.
    2. We want chill, invididual creators who are comfortable hanging out in calls. Not industry plants.
4. The average length of your **videos** should be, at a minimum, around 8 minutes.
    1. If your **videos** are typically short, your application may be rejected for that reason.
    2. We want people who can produce long and thought out **videos**, not quick commentary slop.
5. Your **videos** (and **shorts**, if you do them) must feature good editing and pacing.
    1. Avoid uploading raw, uncut footage.
6. If you do **live streams**, they should be engaging and not feature any **brainrot** **content**.
    1. For example, do not have all of your live streams consist of **brainrot**, **vertical live streams**.
        1. There is nothing wrong with doing **vertical live streams** every now and then, but they should be high quality and original.
7. Your **content** should be consistent in quality and upload schedule.
8. All in all, everything you put out into the world should be high quality and stuff you are proud of.
9. Note that having good **live streams** and **shorts** are not enough to get accepted. See § 2.1.

## 4. Termination

1. We reserve the right to kick DashLink members if they upload any **content** that goes against these standards.
    1. This is true even if they got accepted before breaking these standards.
    2. This means that if you meet these standards and get accepted, but then start releasing **content** that does not meet these standards, we reserve the right to kick you from DashLink.
