title: No More Breaks This Year, I Promise
date: 2023-07-29

Every year, I give myself two weeks off to go on vacation and see family. I have officially used up those weeks for 2023, meaning I should not be travelling anymore except for emergencies.

# Summary

- I give myself two weeks off each year.
- I've already used my two weeks of vacation, meaning I won't be taking any more breaks this year.
- Live streams will resume as normal while we brace for the final quarter of 2023.

July has been a rather complicated month for me. I just so happened to use my two breaks this month, which gave me only 14 days to get a video out instead of the usual 30. Fortunately, we managed to get this month's video done in time.

That's ironic. Because I took two breaks in July, I had to work extra hard. Funny how that happens.

While I have already used my two weeks of breaks, I plan to work extra hard this August to get both August's and September's videos done. This means I can relax a little in September while I get ready for the last quarter of the year, which is the most intense because that's when ad rates are highest (it's no coincidence that your favourite YouTubers upload most then).

I've been saving my best stuff for the final 3 months of the year, so stay tuned for that!

Anyway, with me finally done with all my breaks and busy July, my live streams will finally resume to their regular pre-July schedule.
