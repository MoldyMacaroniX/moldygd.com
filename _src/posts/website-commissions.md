As of today, I thought it would be fun to begin doing website commissions! For just **$30 USD**, I'll make you a website like the ones I currently operate.

**I believe that everyone should have a website.** They are super cheap and easy to host thanks to rapid development in the industry. I can make you a website and help you get it online with a domain (like yourname.com) for just a one time fee of **$30 USD**.<sup>1</sup>

# Here's my portfolio:

- [Dashword.net](https://www.dashword.net/) - Has over 30,000 monthly readers and is constantly growing! Aside from my YouTube, this is my biggest revenue stream.
- [Thumbnail.live](https://www.thumbnail.live/) - Free tool to preview how YouTube titles and thumbnails will look.
- [MoldyGD.com](/) - This very website! It's a place for organizations to learn about me and is home to [my blog](/archive/) where I write about anything I'm interested in.

# Perks you get for going with me:

- I code websites using the Jamstack approach, which in plain English means my sites are optimized, lightning fast, cheap, and easy to run after you commission it!
- I will teach you how to run your commissioned website in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. If you ever need help, you will have access to my direct messages!
- I design the frontend and backend! This means I can both design the look of your website and build its functionality. Most developers are only able to do one of these, but I can do both.
- I can code any design you come up with! If you have a drawing of a design you want, **I can make it a reality**.

# Requirements

I will be able to cover most website requests, but due to the way the Jamstack approach works, I **might** not be able to achieve the following at the base $30 USD fee:

- Paywalled content
- A "social media" app where **anyone** can create an account (I can do **staff** accounts though!)
- E-commerce sites

The above can be a lot more expensive if you plan on hosting it yourself. Instead, there are many services online already available that are able to cover most of these for free or very cheap (i.e. Teespring for merch shops).

That being said, talk to me if you want any of the above as I **might** be able to do it!

That being said, I can do everything else! Even backend content management systems for you and your website staff.

# Price

- It only costs **$30 USD** to commission a website from me and learn how to host it.
- Thanks to my approach to coding websites, **hosting will be free**, meaning you will only have to pay for a domain (if you want one). Domains are very cheap, only being about **$10 USD per year**. I will teach you all this. Thanks to my approach to websites, its easy and cheap.
- I have various methods of payment. Paypal works best but feel free to get in touch with me if you need something else.
- **You don't pay if you don't like the website.** Simple as that. No questions asked.

# What your money goes towards

- I already make enough income to live from my YouTube channel, meaning I will instead be giving 100% of your commission fee to my team who make my videos possible!

# Refunds

- With my system, **you don't pay until after I make you the site!** And if you don't like the site, you don't even have to pay.
- Email me to request a refund. They are available by my discretion or when applicable by law.

# Talk to me

Email me at [moldy@moreyellow.com](mailto:moldy@moreyellow.com) to discuss the commission! Alternatively, if you have access<sup>2</sup> to my direct messages already, you can talk to me there.

_<sup>1</sup>If you want a dedicated domain, like yourname.com you will have to buy one. But don't worry, they're super cheap and I can walk you through it! If you don't want a domain, you will get a subdomain instead, like yourname.netlify.app._

_<sup>2</sup>Access means I've replied to you at least once._
