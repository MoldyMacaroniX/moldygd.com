On August 29th of this year, I met GD Colon and GeoBlitzy in real life! (Along with these [fine](https://x.com/jyro_c) [people](https://x.com/Nillie_VBF).)

This is my third time meeting up with fellow YouTubers/online friends, and what I said in my [CraftyMasterman meetup recap](/craftymasterman-meetup/) applies the same here:

> I usually don't get the opportunity to talk to people (in real life) who also do YouTube so it's nice to meet other YouTubers in the real world!

But unlike my CraftyMasterman and [VidCon](/vidcon/) meetups, we didn't do much YouTube-related stuff like live stream. This was because we weren't at anybody's house, but out about in the wild! While we did post a bit on Twitter ([follow me by the way](https://link.moldygd.com/twitter)), we mostly hung out around Fan Expo, a convention in Toronto.

Hanging out with our [five strong group](https://x.com/MoldyMacaroniX/status/1829400644513390840) was awesome and I can't wait to meet these folks again. Seeing as this time, we all live close to eachother (versus our VidCon meetup requiring us to all fly out from different countries) I can defintely see us organizing future meetups.

That's all for a grand total of **10** other dashers I've met in real life! (If we choose to count CraftyMasterman as a Dasher, that is. [I think I do](https://youtu.be/u2cHRmsYXbk?si=oRhZG7ngly4DJbdp).)
