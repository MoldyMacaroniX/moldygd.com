Here is my attempt to rank my favorite films I've seen. For franchises, I will only include one film per franchise, with the film I chose to include being my favorite from the franchise. But in general, if I include a film from a franchise, I recommend the whole series.

1. **Interstellar (2014) -** Masterpiece in character, plot, and theme (the space theme fits perfectly)
2. **Inception (2010) -** Masterpiece in character and plot
3. **Shutter Island (2010) -** Amazing storytelling and excellent at making you question yourself (you really feel like the protagonist in this one)
4. **The Prestige (2006) -** Amazing plot and plot twist
5. **Dune: Part 2 (2024) -** Immersive world, excellent character building, and unique plot
6. **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) -** Masterpiece in plot (the plot never feels "forced") and motivation (specifically regarding the characters).
7. **Sherlock Holmes (2009) -** Masterpiece in character. I historically haven't been a big fan of the second one but since it has started to grow on me. I still think I prefer the first though.
8. **Tenet (2020) -** Masterpiece in plot
9. **Oppenheimer (2023) -** Masterpeice in immersion (Although this is very likely due to watching it in IMAX. I don't think it would hit as hard at a home theatre.)
10. **Dunkirk (2017) -** Masterpiece in tension

I'll update this list often as I watch more movies.
