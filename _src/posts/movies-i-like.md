Here is my attempt to rank my favorite films I've seen. This list excludes less memorable films. For franchises, I will only include one film per franchise, with the film I chose to include being my favorite from the franchise.

1. **Interstellar (2014) -** Masterpiece in character, plot, and theme (the space theme fits perfectly)
2. **Inception (2010) -** Masterpiece in character and plot
3. **Shutter Island (2010) -** Amazing storytelling and excellent at making you question yourself (you really feel like the protagonist in this one)
4. **The Prestige (2006) -** Amazing plot and plot twist
5. **Dune (2021) -** Immersive world
6. **Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) -** Masterpiece in motivation (the plot never feels "forced")
7. **Sherlock Holmes (2009) -** Masterpiece in character
8. **Tenet (2020) -** Masterpiece in plot
9. **Oppenheimer (2023) -** Masterpeice in immersion (maybe that's just because I saw it in 70MM IMAX, but that's also how Nolan said to view it)
10. **Dunkirk (2017) -** Masterpiece in tension

I'll update this list often as I watch more movies.
