My five biggest issues with Meta Threads:

1. It's just an extension of Instagram, and by extension, features much the same content.
2. Display names are not used outside profiles, making the feed nigh impossible to read.
3. There is a huge lack of features aside from basic functionality.
4. The UI is horrible. I find it very hard to read the low opacity text.
5. The default feed is horrendous and it takes a while to get out of it.

Of these issues, I can see 3 and 4 getting fixed. Maybe 5, but I think Meta would want to stick to their proven Instagram model. I'd love to be proven wrong about this, though.

I cannot see 2 being fixed. Meta seems really stubborn when it comes to this, as is evident by the fact that they've been hiding display names for years, opting to show unique @usernames everywhere instead.

Finally, 1 will not be fixed, because forbid Meta make you create a new account where it won't already know everything about you.
