I should've posted this days ago but happy new year! Anyway, here's a bunch of things in relation to 2025 and 2026 I feel like yapping about:

# Upcoming Zoink Video

Instead of my latest secret coins video, my original plan was to upload a 1+ hour long video featuring Zoink and a bunch of other players. But unfortunately, I bit off way more than I could chew with this video. Despite starting working on it in the summer, the video will probably only release in late January or even sometime in February. It's coming along well but I need more time!

It'll also be the third installment in my traps series and my biggest video yet! It probably won't be as long as my social experiment movie but it'll definitely have taken more time and effort to make.

# Geometry Dash Awards

**First, vote for me here:** [https://forms.gle/Ph92WX98HcG3aCtE7](https://forms.gle/Ph92WX98HcG3aCtE7)

I uploaded half as many videos this year as I did last year. But despite that, my views have more than doubled, which means each individual video was received a lot better! But just because of less videos this year, I'm worried I won't get nominated for this years Geometry Dash Awards.

In case you don't know, the Geometry Dash Awards Best YouTuber category is one I've been gunning for for years, and 2024 was the first year I got the nomination! (Although possibly only barely since I pretty much tied for last place with Sdslayer).

I *really* hope I can still get nominated for Best YouTuber this year, but if not, I hope I stand a chance in the Best Video category. I was hoping I would finish the aforementioned Zoink video in 2025. It not only would be over an hour long, but it would've probably gotten way more views than my social experiment video, making it a prime candidate for a nomination in the Best Video category.

Regardless, I hope my social experiment movie (titled "Would You Risk $100 For $1000" on YouTube) will get nominated. It isn't at all edited like a YouTube video, with it instead resembling a full on movie. Instead of treating each POV as, well, a POV, I treated it as a camera watching the action unfold. That is also why I made the executive decision to cut out Tatox3's facecam from the video, since I think it would've broken the immersion.

For the first suggestions form, I had my audience suggest my 100 players video for this category, although that was only because the social experiment video wasn't out yet. While I'll also be happy with that getting nominated, my goal for this year is to get my social experiment movie nominated! It is my biggest and most expensive video ever to date and I'm really proud of how it came out (although if I could go back I would definitely change a few things...as with all my videos).

# YouTuber Shoutouts

In 2025, I said I would shoutout an upcoming Geometry Dash YouTuber every month. However, I missed three months, meaning I will be shouting out three more this year.

I will then throughout this year make an effort to send each person I shouted out an invite to at least one future Moldy video. But do note that there is no guarantee they will be able to accept it and I can't guarantee anymore invites.

Also, there have been so many more YouTubers who popped off last year than I expected, so I will also try and still invite new upcoming YouTubers even if I never shouted them out.

# The Dashlands Rated

Out of nowhere, my first platformer level, The Dashlands, was rated after over a year!

While I am no longer super proud of this level, it is still technically the most amount of time I've ever put into a level (BetterInfo says I spent around 60 hours in the editor). This makes sense, since it is also my most technically impressive level.

I'd love to revisit the idea with better visuals and especially better gameplay, but I find it hard enough to come up with unique gameplay gimmicks for my regular levels. And a level like this would need around 6 entirely unique levels, meaning 6 entirely unique gimmicks. And whenever I come up with a really cool gimmick, I'd rather make a whole level dedicated to it.

That is why the gimmicks for The Dashlands were kind of meh. If they were really good, I would've rather used them in their own levels. So really it is only the scrapped, meh ideas that made it here.

Now you might be thinking, why not just reuse cool gimmicks in both an individual level and as part of a bigger level like The Dashlands? And the reason isn't because I don't want to reuse ideas, but because I don't want to have to remake ideas. Boom Block Base, a level of mine with a really cool gimmick, took a long time to make. So good luck convincing me to spend even more time on the SAME gimmick instead of something new. I like how Boom Block Base came out, but I'm done with that gimmick now. I've spent too much time with it already.

In the future, I would still love to find a way to make a level like The Dashlands but with better gimmicks. But the gimmicks probably won't be as ambitious as the one in Boom Block Base.

The Dashlands getting rated also gives me hope for The Centrifuge getting rated, my current hardest completed level.

But either way thanks RobTop for the feature!

# April Fools Video

Unlike previous years, I plan to make an April Fools video this year! I won't reveal it just yet but I expect it to be over an hour long and it'll feature many of your favorite Geometry Dash YouTubers. It should be good if I can finish it in time!

In the *very* unlikely event I fail to finish it time, I will either regrettably upload it later this year (perhaps May 1st) or save it for 2027.

# University

Throughout all this time, I've spent about half of each year slowly working towards a computer science degree. And I am currently in my last semester and will be graduating should everything go well.

But as is to be expected, this semester will be tough on me. So I probably won't upload much until April/May. But after then, I will be doing YouTube full time.

Yes, this does mean I won't be using my computer science degree. In fact, I probably should've dropped out years ago, since I've known for years now that YouTube will be my full time job. But because of the age old "what'll you do if YouTube disappears tomorrow?" question, I figured I might as well get the degree at this point, my wallet be damned (fortunately university is cheap-er here in Canada).

# After University

While YouTube will be my primary focus after university, I still like programming! As such, I plan to fully develop and release a game. Plans are still vague, but my rough idea is a platformer with a unique gimmick (no clue what that is yet) with a fully functional and super advanced (but still easy to use) level editor. Like Geometry Dash, the game will have online servers where players can upload their levels.

While not planned for the 1.0 release, if the game does well, I even plan to add live multiplayer and allow creators to make "mini game" levels. Players will then be able to create their own multiplayer mini games where players will be able to compete against others for rewards.

But let me clear: while I have started work on a rough engine, just the 1.0 release of such a game will take **years** to happen. I expect a development timeline of *at least* 3+ years before I release the first version (although maybe a timeline of 4-5 years is more likely). But fortunately, I do plan to release free demos after 1-2 years to get community feedback. These free demos will basically come with the entire game so far minus any online features (as that costs me money for servers). I do plan though to make a feature where players can publish levels as files, so even players who play on the free demo versions will be able to share their levels with others!

I have a decent budget set for this project, but it will only be spent on art, SFX, and music. All programming will be done by me. I don't have any plans to fundraise for this project because thankfully my YouTube channel pays me well at the moment. Let's hope that continues to be the case!

If this is a game you'd be interested in, feel free to [let me know](/contact/)! The more people who seem interested will mean the more motivation I have to pull through and finish such a project.

But of course, YouTube will always be my #1 priority as that is my main source of income. But on the side, I plan to slowly chip away at this project.

# About this blog

In September 2024, I said I was going to [move this blog somewhere else](/website-migration/). Now, that is no longer happening, but for a year after that announcement I never wrote anything in this blog because I knew if I were to move it it'd only be giving me more things to transfer.

But that was a mistake. I ended up missing covering super amazing experiences like VidCon 2025. To make up for it, I'll probably cover these events this year, even if that's way later than I should've.

[This website is being resigned](/website-update/), but this blog will be staying right here!
