I genuinely want to connect with up and coming Geometry Dash YouTubers of any size! As such, I allow collab invitations from anyone, no matter their size. If you're a Geometry Dash YouTuber who wants to invite me to your video, continue reading!

*Note that I no longer accept mega collab invites from people I don't know very well, so please, do not send them to me! This guide is only for video invites.*

# Prerequisites

This guide is mostly for smaller, up and coming creators. If you're already an established YouTuber, chances are I probably already know who you are and you can just get in touch with me whichever way works best.

For the rest of you, **please do not invite me to your video unless you have already have a history of making and finishing videos!** Make sure your channel already has good videos uploaded before inviting me to one. I won't join your first video.

I don't care how many subscribers or views you have. But you need to have some good videos uploaded already so I know you're legit.

# How To Invite Me

If you want to invite me to your video, [send me a message via any of my active social media](/social-media/) and make sure to include the following information:

- The kind of content you make
- Your idea (for the video you want to invite me to)
- Your channel link

Please don't just say "hi" and wait for a response! Send your proposition as your first message to me, otherwise I won't respond.

Here's a good template:

```
Hey! I'm a GD YouTuber that does [CONTENT TYPE]. I have an idea for a video where [YOUR IDEA]. I'd love to know if you're interested. Here is my channel link: [YOUR CHANNEL LINK]
```

Please don't copy this template word for word! I don't want to see the same thing sent to me over and over again.
