For more information on how to invite me to collabs, see my [collab invitation guide](/collabs/).

Due to working on my Geometry Dash 2.2 content plans, I will not be accepting any creator collabs during the month of September.

I will still be open to sponsorships, however. If you would like to promote something with me, send me an email at [moldy@moreyellow.com](mailto:moldy@moreyellow.com).

With [Geometry Dash update 2.2 being released in October](https://www.dashword.net/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/), I've had to work on a new content plan for the fourth quarter of the year. Fortunately, I'm making good process, with many amazing Geometry Dash 2.2 videos planned for the update.

However, as I finalize this plan, I will be too occupied to participate in any new creator collabs during the month of September.

I will still partake in collabs I've already agreed to, but I won't join any new ones.

If you're a creator who wants to collab, you can still [contact me](/contact/) about it if you're fine waiting until 2.2, but beware that I will not be accepting any more collabs in the 2.1 update.
