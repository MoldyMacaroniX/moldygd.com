                    Feel free to pitch me anything! My rate is highly negotiable, as I want you to get the best promotion I can possibly give.

                <p>
                    That being said, I prefer video integrations for a CPM rate. I generally don't do sponsored live streams or dedicated videos for brands, but feel free to pitch me your idea!

                    I will typically respond to emails within a couple days. If I don't, chances are I missed it.

                    When emailing me, please make sure that you email from your company's address. For example, use a company email address like you@yourcompany.com instead of you@gmail.com.

                    It is possible your email got flagged by my spam filter. Make sure your email is professional so that it doesn't get filtered out.
